                <h3>How do I upgrade or downgrade my plan?</h3>
                <p>Managing your plan is straightforward. Whether you wish to add, upgrade, refund, or cancel your
                    order, simply navigate to the 'Order' section once you've logged into your account. From there,
                    you'll find all the tools and options you need to adjust your plan according to your preferences.

                <h3>Do you offer refunds?</h3>
                <p>If your purchase is limited to RFID tags, you possess a 24-hour window from the time of order to
                    initiate a refund. This process can be effortlessly facilitated through the 'Order' section upon
                    logging into your account. As for subscription services, while direct refunds are not available, we
                    do provide an option for cancellations. Once your subscription payment has been processed, you
                    retain the flexibility to cancel it. Rest assured, no subsequent charges will be incurred for the
                    upcoming month, and our services will persist uninterrupted until the conclusion of the current
                    billing cycle.</p>
